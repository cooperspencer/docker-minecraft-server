# docker-minecraft-server
I am using the sources from [https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server](docker-minecraft-server) but this container is compiled for a raspberry pi 4.
All the environment variables that are working on [itzgs' minecraft server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) are also working here.
